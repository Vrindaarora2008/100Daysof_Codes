/*Q121: Write a C program that creates a text file named info.txt in write mode. The program should take the user’s name and age as input, and write them to the file using fprintf(). After writing, display a message confirming that the data was successfully saved.
Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
Name: Rahul, Age: 23
Output 1:
File created successfully! Data written to info.txt*/
#include <stdio.h>

{
    FILE *fp;                
    char name[100];
    int age;
    fp = fopen("info.txt", "w");
    if (fp==NULL)
